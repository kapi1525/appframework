Framework i made to help me with creating simple terminal apps.
If you want to use this, [here](https://github.com/kapigames/apf_template) you'll find a template with some comments explaining how some things work.
This framework should work with Windows and any posix os aka Linux, MacOS and other unix like OS'es.
Any modern C++17 compiler should work, but these 100% should work:
- MSVC 19.31 on Windows
- g++ 9.4    on linux
- clang 13   on MacOS
