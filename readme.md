Simple framework to help me with simple terminal programs .
I just add random stuff here that i happen to need, you shouldnt really use it.

Fully works on:
- Windows:
  - MSVC
  - clang
  - gcc     (gcc 9 is required and actions has only 8 :/)
- Linux:
  - gcc
  - clang

Semi working on:
- MacOS:    (many things are not implemented like files.cpp)
  - clang
  - gcc

If you for what ever reason want to use this [here](https://github.com/kapigames/apf_template) you can find simple template with some comments explaining stuff.
